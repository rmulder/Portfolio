# Portfolio
The source code for my personal portfolio I'm sharing the code so prospect clients can view some of my skills in making MEAN stack applications. I use webpack to package my assets: fonts; images; sass and typescript using the appropriate loaders and the ExtractTextPlugin to separate the files.

# Building
package.json - Contains the development and project dependencies just clone the repository and run "npm i" to install all dependencies

webpack.config.js - bundles required files for release, to build the website use 'npm run build' or to start dev server use 'npm start'
